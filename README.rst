Project GITenberg
=================

Lets fork `Project Gutenberg`_ to github and call it Project GITenberg.

.. _Project Gutenberg: http://gutenberg.org


Why?
====

Project Gutenberg is awesome!
The public domain is awesome.
Git is awesome.

But Project Gutenberg doesn't use a version control system.
And they have a high barrier to entry to edit books.
Aaaand they don't have a public bug tracking system.

Moving PG to Github helps with these issues,
and has many other side-effect benefits.


What?
=====

This repo does three things via the `gitbook` command.

+ fetches books from PG
+ makes a local git repo with extra files
+ creates a repo on github and pushes to it (one per book)


Project Gutenberg Stats
=======================

Estimated 1.6 million files
Reported 650 GB total
~40,000 + books
